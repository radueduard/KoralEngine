# kgraph: the pass graph

`modules/kgraph` is a scene's pass graph: the nodes the editor will draw, kept as data, and the runtime
that turns them into GPU objects and render passes. It links the framework and kecs. It is built only
when the Koral SDK is found (`-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<GFX>/stage/debug`).

```cpp
kgraph::Graph graph;
std::string error;
kgraph::Graph::FromJson(text, graph, error);

kgraph::Runtime runtime(scene.Graph());      // the scene's kor::FrameGraph
runtime.Set(graph);                          // builds what the nodes describe
for (const auto& problem : runtime.Problems()) kor::log::error("{}", problem);
// each frame, before the frame graph runs:
runtime.Update();
```

## The graph, as data

A `Graph` is a list of `Node`s. A node has an id, a type, a title and a position for the editor, and
inputs by name. An input is a value or a link to another node's output.

```json
{ "kgraph": 1, "nodes": [
  { "id": "target", "type": "Image", "inputs": {
      "format": "eRGBA8_UNORM", "extent.x": 64, "extent.y": 64,
      "usage": ["eStorage", "eTransferSrc", "eTransferDst"] } },
  { "id": "shader", "type": "Shader", "inputs": { "entryPoint.module": "fill", "entryPoint.entry": "computeMain" } },
  { "id": "pipeline", "type": "ComputePipeline", "inputs": {
      "computeShader": { "$link": ["shader", "out"] },
      "param.target": { "$link": ["target", "out"] },
      "constant.level": 0.5 } },
  { "id": "run", "type": "Dispatch", "inputs": { "pipeline": { "$link": ["pipeline", "out"] }, "groups.x": 8, "groups.y": 8 } }
] }
```

Values are JSON's own: numbers, booleans, strings, lists and objects. An enum is its name, flags are a
list of names, a vector is a list of numbers, and a struct is an object by field name. `Graph::ToJson`
and `Graph::FromJson` round-trip a graph exactly.

## Node types

`kgraph::Catalog()` lists them, with every input and output, its type and its description. This is what
the editor will build its node list and its nodes from.

- **One for each builder the framework describes** (`kor::builders`): Buffer, Image, ImageView, Sampler,
  BufferView, Shader, Framebuffer, Mesh, AccelerationStructure and the three pipelines. A builder setting
  with one argument is an input of that name. With several it is one input per argument:
  `extent.x`, `entryPoint.module`. A setting that can be given more than once is `color[].view`, written
  in a graph as `color[0].view`, `color[1].view`. Nothing is written by hand: a builder that gains a
  setting gains the input.
- **Values:** Number, Bool, String, Vector, and Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Min, Max, Negate, Abs,
  Floor, Ceil, Round, Component and ImageExtent. The operations work on numbers and, a component at a
  time, on vectors.
- **Screen** is the scene's window. **Reference** stands for another node by id, for a resource used far
  from where it is made.
- **Passes:** Clear, Blit and Dispatch. Draws, and passes that run per entity, come with E4.

## Pipelines

A pipeline node's shaders decide two more groups of inputs, listed by `Runtime::PortsOf(id)` once it has
built:

- `param.<name>` for each resource the shaders declare. Those that are wired go in descriptor set 0,
  which the pipeline owns and binds once. Those left unwired go in set 1 and are returned by
  `PerEntityParameters(id)`: they are what each entity will supply. With none left, the pipeline runs
  once. Bindings written in the shader are ignored. The runtime numbers them.
- `constant.<name>` for each specialization constant.

A parameter wired to a resource of the wrong kind, or a name the shaders don't have, is an error on the
node that lists what the shaders do declare.

## Evaluation

`Runtime::Set(graph)` evaluates the nodes in dependency order. Each node has a signature made from its
type, its values and which build of each node it is wired to. A node is built again only when its
signature changes, so editing one constant rebuilds the pipeline and the pass that runs it and leaves
the image, the shader and every other pass alone. Moving a node rebuilds nothing.
`Status(id)->builds` counts builds.

A node that fails keeps the error (`Status(id)->error`). Nodes wired to it fail with "wired to 'x', which
failed", and everything else keeps running. A cycle is reported on the nodes in it.

A resource is shared by the nodes and passes that use it and freed when the last one lets go, so taking
a node out of the graph frees what it made.

When a shader file is edited, the framework reloads it, and `Update()` rebuilds the pipelines made from
it on the next frame.

## Order

Passes are installed in the scene's `kor::FrameGraph`, which orders them by the resources they read and
write. Where a pass sits in the node list doesn't matter. The frame graph runs two writers of the same
resource in the order they were added, so kgraph adds a pass that only overwrites a resource (Clear)
before one that reads and writes it (Dispatch on a read-write image). Two passes that both modify the
same resource run in node-list order: usage does not say which is first.

## Limits

- Draw commands, per-entity passes and the generated component are E4. A Dispatch whose pipeline has
  unwired parameters is an error that says so.
- A struct input given some of its fields has the rest zeroed, not defaulted.
- The framework keeps every shader it compiled, by module and entry point, for the life of the app.
- Initial data (an image's pixels, a buffer's bytes) can't be given in a graph.
